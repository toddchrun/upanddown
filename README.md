Up and Down the River (a card game)

Overview

Up and Down the River is a simple trick taking card game.  For 3 or more players (ideally less than 8 max, and face it, you don't have that many friends).  The object of the game is simple, each player is dealt a card(s) corresponding to the current round of the game (starts at 1!).  After each player has their designated cards for the given round, the remaining deck is placed in the middle and the top card is flip up to reveal the "trick suit".  This suit determines the "trick suit" for each round of play.  Bidding then commences.  The objective of the round (and game) is to bid the number of tricks you will take.  Each player plays one card until all cards have been discarded.  Score is then determined based on how many tricks you bid vs. how many you actual took during play.
